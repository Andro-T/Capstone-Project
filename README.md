# The New Age of Investing: Disrupting Benchmarks





## Background

Asset Management companies seperate their total amount of Assets Under Management (total market value of all financial assets) into seperate portfolios. These portfolios usually each have one or a few Portfolio Managers (PM) responsible for running the pool of money allocated to that portfolio. The performance of these portfolios is measured relative to a "benchmark". A benchmark is an index of stocks or a reference portfolio which replicates the performance of a combination of different stocks which can be split by different features, the most common ones being geography or industry and others include investment style (Growth vs Value), special opportunities, thematic, etc. Two of the most commonly referenced benchmarks, which have become synonymous for stock market performance in the US, are the S&P 500 and Dow Jones. Each portfolio is assigned a specific benchmark relative to which it's performance is measured. The aim of the Portfolio Manager is to outperform the benchmark, this outperformance is called Alpha. Even if the Portfolio outperforms the market as a whole, if it does not outperform its benchmark it is seen as an underperforming portfolio. 

This topic becomes relevant given the vastly different growth rates of different coverages. Consider the following scenario, Tech stocks experience signficantly higher growth rates than Industrials, if two portfolios each covering one of the industries were measured against the same benchmark the Tech Portfolio would appear to be performing much better even though the Industrials PM has a much worse performing pool of stocks to pick from than their Tech counterpart. To counteract this, each Portfolio would be set against a specific benchmark that would represent a fairer approximation of the average returns that could be generated within the set of stocks that they could choose from. Having this distinction allows for the often cyclical nature of industries to be considered when assessing a portfolio's performance. The reason for seperating out different industries/themes/geogrpahies for each portfolio is because of the various risk appetites of different investors, e.g. a teenage investor may be willing to take on a lot more risk because of the long investing time frame over a pensioner who is looking to minimize the possibility of reduction in value over growth. 


## The Problem

The standard approach to setting or selecting a benchmark is to pick stocks within a similar sector such as Lesiure, Indutrials, Tech, Oil&Gas and then often split them by Market (US, EU, Emerging Markets and even smaller geogrpahic subsets such as Nordics). These stocks are then also filtered by the Market Capitalization of each stock which are often binned into four groups: 
1. Micro Cap - Less than $300 Million
2. Small Cap - Between $300 Million and $2 Billion
3. Mid Cap - Between $2 and $10 Billion
4. Large Cap - Over $10 Billion

An example of a few possible portfolios:
1. Large Cap European Consumer Discretionary - Would include stocks such as: LVMH, Hermes, JD Sports, Adidas, Kerring and other similar names.
2. Nordic Industrials - Companies such as Volvo, Sandvik, Atlas Copco, and Inditrade. 
3. Large Cap US Tech - Facebook, Google, Twitter, Apple, etc.

Now the issue we are trying to tackle with this project, is to identify new groupings that are not restricted by these traditional grouipings often linked to the companies' product and location. This is becoming more relevant as a growing number of stocks have increasing overlap in multiple sectors, partially due to the proliferation of tech in just about every industry. Consider a few examples:

- **Deliveroo** - Any food delivery platform could be classified as a Logistics business, a part of the Food Industry or just a Tech company. 
- **Tesla** - Taking the world by storm, this company can be grouped as an Automaker, Tech company, or an Environmtal/Clean Energy stock.  
- **Ferrari** - Another company that was originally considered as an Automaker, but as a company, has the performance of a Luxury brand. 
- **AirBnB** - Seen as one of **the** best examples of a stock that disrupted an industry, AirBnB has been considered both as a lodging company (grouped with hotels) and as a tech company.

These stocks embody why it's important to have more of a flexible approach to benchmarks. When valuing a company, generally, the multiple (the price you're willing to pay for future earnings and/or cash flow) is determined by its peer group. If you do not set the company you are analyzing against stocks that actually perform similarly you risk either over or undervaluing the company. Ferrari, above, being a prime example: when considered as a Car manufacturer, the share price was considered as too expensive, but in reality the performance and nature of the company and stock warranted valuing it as a Luxury brand. 


## Our Goal

Potential Uses for this work

1. Create new benchmarks that have stocks of a similar nature regardless of industry. 

2. Use this for valuation. If you are running a valuation of a stock, this model will return stocks that have similar financial stats and might help pick the multiples that are the most appropriate. 

3. If a PM today, working within a benchmark, were to use this analysis it would allow a preliminary seperation of stocks that would either either over or underperform, reducing the number and prioritizing the order of stocks that a fundamental analysis would be carried out on.,
